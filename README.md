# Arduino support for ESP8266


To program ESP8266, you need a USB to serial converter. Note that the Explore Wifi board has on board 3.3v regulator and circuitry to reset the board and put it in programming mode. 
## I have used the code to scan and display the available WiFi Networks. 
## Once you upload the program, you should be able to see the WiFi networks available at your place
