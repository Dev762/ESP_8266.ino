# Arduino support for ESP8266
Test Example

To program ESP8266, you need a USB to serial converter. Image below shows connections made from Explore USB to Serial and Explore Wifi boards. Note that the Explore Wifi board has on board 3.3v regulator and circuitry to reset the board and put it in programming mode. 
## I have used the sample code below to scan and display the available WiFi Networks. 
## Once you upload the program, you should be able to see the WiFi networks available at your place
